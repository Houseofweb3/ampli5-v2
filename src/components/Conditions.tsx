                  The Client is responsible for providing all content required for the campaign.
                  House of Web3 can assist in developing a content strategy at an additional cost,
                  but delays due to content approval are not the responsibility of House of Web3.

                  House of Web3 guarantees campaign initiation (defined as the first influencer
                  post) within 72 hours of contract signing and payment receipt. However, the
                  complete campaign timeline will vary based on the scope and deliverables outlined
                  in the contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Campaign initiation means at least 1 or 2 influencers will begin posting content
                  within 72 hours. The exact number of influencers posting will be agreed upon in
                  the contract.
