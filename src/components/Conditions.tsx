                  The Client is responsible for providing all content required
                  for the campaign. House of Web3 can assist in developing a
                  content strategy at an additional cost, but delays due to
                  content approval are not the responsibility of House of Web3.

                  House of Web3 guarantees campaign initiation (defined as the
                  first influencer post) within 72 hours of contract signing and
                  payment receipt. However, the complete campaign timeline will
                  vary based on the scope and deliverables outlined in the
                  contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Campaign initiation means at least 1 or 2 influencers will
                  begin posting content within 72 hours. The exact number of
                  influencers posting will be agreed upon in the contract.
